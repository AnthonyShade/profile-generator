## Description
[DISCLAIMER!!! The walkthrough video does NOT show the tests passing in bash, this is because whenever I tried to while recording, it would fail. However, if you run the npm test they WILL pass, and I have attatched a screenshot of them passing in the assets folder, I very much apologize, I wasnt able to figure out why this happened. !!!DISCLAIMER] This is a team generator, that will create an HTML file tthat  displays the new team structure, it also allows you to email the members and links to the github accounts.
